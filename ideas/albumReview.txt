We can use discord modals to prompt the user for rating/reviewing the albums in the aoty list.
Give the user a list of all albums in the aoty list, query the user for a numeric rating and reasoning for the rating.
Also prompt them for a decision for this album (delete, leave in list, move to liked list)

Alternatively, we can use Application Commands message context menu, for interacting with an album:
https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands
e.g. have the following options in the context menu: Rate (launch modal), Delete, Move to Liked List, Leave in List etc.
Possibly also use select menus:

We will need to move from !commands to slash commands for this to work
